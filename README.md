# JamNext

The goal of the repo is to **learn a transformation for a Web app written entirely SPA style into JAM**.

✨ And the JAM as it is understood and promoted by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework ✨

## Monorepo content

1. json-server: a simple backend with mountain REST API
2. jam-spa: a SPA version of mountains app
3. jam-spa-e2e: tests for SPA app
4. jam-next: Next.js version of mountain app
5. jam-next-e2e: tests for Next.js app

## The course content 

- [00-initial](https://github.com/llaszkie/jam-next/tree/00-initial): project structure like generated initially by `nx` and sample SPA app ready
- [01-start](https://github.com/llaszkie/jam-next/tree/01-start): enhancements: TailwindCSS for Next.js

## Start the app 

### BE
To start the API server run `nx serve json-server`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

### FE: SPA
To start the development server run `nx serve jam-spa`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. 

### FE: Next
To start the development server run `nx dev jam-next`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/.

Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
